# LinkedIn Service 

The **LinkedIn Service** allows you to retrieve or publish data to the LinkedIn graph. Examples of the types of objects you can work with are User profile data and sharing Activity.

## Creating a new Application on LinkedIn Developer Site

1. Go to: https://www.linkedin.com/developer/apps. 
2. Select **Create Application**, to start integrating LinkedIn into your app. 
3. Complete all mandatory fields signified by the red star.  If you agree to the terms and conditions, hit **Submit**.
4. Make a note of the **Client Id** and **Client Secret** for your app - you will need to supply these in your code.
5. Take note of the **Default Application Permissions**.  You can either set these in this portal or via code.  These are the permissions your user will need to agree to for you to make calls on their behalf.
6. Under **OAuth 2.0** you will need to enter a **Authorized Redirect URLs**.  For UWP app development purposes this is arbitrary, but it will need to match what you have in your code (e.g. https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsCommunityToolkit/).
7. Once you have done, hit **Update**.

## Syntax

```csharp
// Initialize service - use overload if you need to supply additional permissions
LinkedInService.Instance.Initialize(ClientId.Text, ClientSecret.Text, CallbackUri.Text);

// Login to LinkedIn
if (!await LinkedInService.Instance.LoginAsync())
{
    return;
}

// Get current user's profile details
await LinkedInService.Instance.GetUserProfileAsync();

// Share message to LinkedIn (text should include a Url so LinkedIn can scrape preview information)
await LinkedInService.Instance.ShareActivityAsync(ShareText.Text);
```
```vb
' Initialize service - use overload if you need to supply additional permissions
LinkedInService.Instance.Initialize(ClientId.Text, ClientSecret.Text, CallbackUri.Text)

' Login to LinkedIn
If Not Await LinkedInService.Instance.LoginAsync() Then
    Return
End If

' Get current user's profile details
Await LinkedInService.Instance.GetUserProfileAsync()

' Share message to LinkedIn (text should include a Url so LinkedIn can scrape preview information)
Await LinkedInService.Instance.ShareActivityAsync(ShareText.Text)
```
