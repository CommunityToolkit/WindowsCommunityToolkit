# How to: Implement editing and input validation in DataGrid control

## Cell and Row editing
The [DataGrid](../datagrid.md) control supports cell and row editing functionality. By default, you can edit items directly in the DataGrid. The user can enter edit mode in a cell by pressing F2 key or double tapping on a cell. Alternatively, you can set the **IsReadOnly** property to true to disable editing in the DataGrid. 

```xml
<controls:DataGrid BeginningEdit="dg_Editing" CellEditEnding="dg_CellEditEnding" RowEditEnding="dg_RowEditEnding" />
```

A cell-level edit is committed when you move to another cell in the same row. All edits in a row are committed when you press ENTER or move to another row. 

To guarantee that edits can be committed and canceled correctly, the objects in the DataGrid must implement the [IEditableObject](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.ieditableobject(v=vs.110).aspx) interface. 

### Editing methods and events

The following table lists the methods and events supported by DataGrid for cell and row editing functionality.

Type | Name | Description
---|--- | ---
Method | PreparingCellForEdit | Occurs when a cell in a DataGridTemplateColumn enters editing mode. This event does not occur for cells in other column types.
Method | PrepareCellForEdit | Occurs when a cell in a column derived from DataGridColumn enters editing mode. This event does not occur for cells of type DataGridTemplateColumn.
Method | BeginEdit | Causes the data grid to enter editing mode for the current cell and current row, unless the data grid is already in editing mode.
Method | CommitEdit | Causes the data grid to commit the current edit to the data source, and optionally exit editing mode.
Method | CancelEdit | Causes the data grid to cancel the current edit, restore the original value, and exit editing mode.
Event | BeginningEdit | Occurs before a cell or row enters editing mode. This event lets you perform special processing before a cell or row enters editing mode. 
Event | CellEditEnding | Occurs when a cell edit is ending. You can cancel this event by setting the Cancel property of the e argument to true in the event handler. If this event is not canceled, the specified **EditAction** will be performed to commit or cancel the edit. After the edit has been successfully committed or canceled, the CellEditEnded event occurs.
Event | CellEditEnded | Occurs when a cell edit has been committed or canceled.
Event | RowEditEnding | Occurs when a row edit is ending. You can cancel this event by setting the Cancel property of the e argument to true in the event handler. If this event is not canceled, the specified **EditAction** will be performed to commit or cancel the edit. After the edit has been successfully committed or canceled, the RowEditEnded event occurs.
Event | RowEditEnded | Occurs when a row edit has been committed or canceled.

### Enumerations

* **DataGridEditAction** enumeration : Specifies constants that define what action was taken to end an edit. Supported members are:
   * Cancel: Edit was canceled.
   * Commit: Edit was committed.
* **DataGridEditingUnit** enumeration : Specifies constants that define whether editing is enabled on a cell level or on a row level. Supported members are:
   * Cell: Cell editing is enabled.
   * Row: Row editing is enabled.

## Input Validation

DataGrid control supports input validation through **INotifyDataErrorInfo** in your DataModel or ViewModel. Implement data validation logic by implementing **DataErrorsChangedEventArgs**, **HasErrors** and **GetErrors** methods. The DataGrid control automatically shows the error UI in the editing cell/row when the error conditions are met.

See [DataGrid Sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsCommunityToolkit//tree/harinikmsft/datagrid/Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.SampleApp/SamplePages/DataGrid) for an example of how to handle input validation in the DataGrid control.
