# UWP Community Toolkit Known Issues

> [!NOTE]
For an accurate list of known bugs and issues, take a look at the [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit/issues)


## Services

* UnresolvableAssemblyReference when building for Release when using the Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.Services package
This error will not be fixed until the 3.0 release as it requires a breaking change. The workaround is to manually add a reference to the Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory package, version 2.29.0 (or any version between 2.22 and 3.0) - [see issue for more details](https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit/issues/1788)


## Controls

### MasterDetailsView
* Back button does not close the details view in some cases - [see issue for detials](https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit/issues/1589)
* Setting background to transparent causes Master and Detail view to overlap in narrow view - [see issue for detials](https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit/issues/1117)
* MasterDetailsView does not adapt to keyboard control in details view - [see issue for detials](https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit/issues/791)

### ScrollHeader
* ScrollHeader with `Mode="Sticky"` inside a ListView with grouped items causes the groups' headers to be displayed in front of the header - [see issue for details](https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit/issues/1446)

### HamburgerMenu
