0.2 TODO:
Root-cause and fix the precomps that have missing content (e.g. Camera_debug.json)

Support markers in Lottie XML.
Add markup extension support for LottieComposition.
Use an ExpressionAnimation on a PropertySet to support multiplication of opacity when color and opacity are both animated.
Inherit opacity through a precomp.
Draw gradient fills and strokes.
Optimize layer visibility animations.
Support transforms on solid layers.
Parse repeaters.
Spatial beziers.
Validation: precomp refid only refers to an asset that contains Layers.
Validation: any refid refers to an asset that exist.
Validation: supported features of the translator.

Other:
Unloading/disposing needs to stop the player and release all asyncs.

- Add the markup extension, so Source will be specified as:
  {lottie:LottieFile Path="Assets\foobar.json"}, and eliminate the attribute that makes this work
  automatically.
* Make sure we can specify a simple file path for the Source property - it should
  imply the ms://appx thing.
* Remove the Progress property. Add position parameters to Play(), and Pause().
  -- Can we do a markup extension so that <Source> can be set with URIs that refer
     to pre-translated code sometimes, and Json at other times?
	  YES!: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47156782/how-does-one-use-the-uwp-markupextension-class
	  {lottie:JsonAsset Path="Assets\Foo"}
	  {lottie:AnimatedVisualFactory Name="Foobar"}
