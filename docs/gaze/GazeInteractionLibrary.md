# Gaze Interaction Library

Microsoft announced native support for eye tracking in Windows in the [Windows 10 Fall Creators Update](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/accessibility/2017/08/01/from-hack-to-product-microsoft-empowers-people-with-eye-control-for-windows-10/). In the Windows 10 April 2018 update, Microsoft added developer support by releasing [Windows Gaze Input APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.devices.input.preview) to build UWP applications that can interact with gaze input and eye trackers.

This Gaze Interaction Library is built on top of the Windows Gaze Input APIs and provides a set of developer helper classes to more easily enable UWP applications to respond to where the user is looking on the screen. This library is intended to abstract away some of the complexities of dealing with the raw stream of gaze input coming from the eye tracking device exposed through the Windows APIs.

## Prerequisites

In order to use the Windows 10 Gaze Input APIs or this Gaze Interaction Library, you need to have the following:

* A device with the Windows 10 April 2018 Update
* A [supported eye tracker](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4043921/windows-10-get-started-eye-control#supported-devices), like the [Tobii EyeX 4C](https://tobiigaming.com/products/)

## Supported Features

The Gaze Interaction Library currently supports the following features:

* Dwell based activation of XAML controls, like buttons, toggle buttons, check boxes, etc.
* Enabling gaze interactions for the entire XAML page or for a portion of it (like a single control)
* Customizing the dwell times associated with specific controls
* Controlling repetition of the dwell invocation of controls

## Gaze Concepts

Below are a few eye gaze related concepts that are helpful in order to better understand the rest of the document:

* **Saccade.** A saccade is a rapid movement of the eyes from one fixation point to another. Our eyes alternate between fixations and saccades.
* **Fixation.**  A fixation is the collection of gaze points on a single location of the screen for a relatively short amount of time (roughly around 200ms). This happens after a saccade when the eye comes to rest upon an object and it comes into sharp focus.
* **Dwell.** A dwell is the concious fixation by the user for a duration greater than the fixation time. This  mechanism is typically used to identify user intent when the user is using only their eyes as an input method. The dwell time duration can be application and control dependent.
* **Enter/Exit.** These are states and properties specific to this API to help manage gaze related interactions and refer to the time elapsed since the first recorded gaze sample and the last recorded gaze sample on a particular control (Button, ToggleButton etc.)

The Gaze Interaction Library enables dwell based gaze interactions on the page by reading the data from the eye tracker over the page invoking specific controls when the user's gaze dwells on a control for a specific time. The application can configure this time based on its usage scenario.

## <a name="pointerstate">PointerState Properties</a>

The Windows Gaze Input APIs delivers a stream of timestamped gaze point coordinates of the user's gaze location on the screen. This  library aggregates these samples over each control and converts the stream into gaze events. Corresponding to these events, are the following states:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
|Enter | enum | A user's gaze has entered the control |
|Fixation | enum | A user eye's are focused on the control. |
|Dwell | enum | A user is conciously dwelling on the control and has exceeded the dwell time. This is interpreted as the user's intent to activate or invoke the control, e.g. click a button|
|Exit | enum | A user's gaze is no longer within the control|


## GazeInput Properties

If the XAML page is enabled for gaze based interactions, the visibility and size of the gaze cursor, and the timings associated with the states above can be configured using the properties below:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| IsDeviceAvailable | bool | Returns whether a compatible eye tracker is connected. When this property changes an `IsDeviceAvailableChanged` event is fired. |
| Interaction | enum | Gets or sets the status of gaze interaction over that particular XAML element.  There are three options: <br /> <ul> <li>**Enabled.**  Gaze interaction is enabled on this element and all its children </li> <li> **Disabled** Gaze interaction is disabled on this element and all its children <li> **Inherited** Gaze interaction status is inherited from the nearest ancestor </ul>| 
| CursorVisible | bool | The gaze cursor shows where the user is looking at on the screen. This boolean property shows the gaze cursor when set to `true` and hides it when set to `false`. The default value is `false`|
|CursorRadius|int| Gets or sets the size of the gaze cursor radius. The default value is X|
| ThresholdDuration | TimeSpan | This duration controls when the PointerState moves to either the `Enter` state or the `Exit` state. When this duration has elapsed after the user's gaze first enters a control, the `PointerState` is set to `Enter`. And when this duration has elapsed after the user's gaze has left the control, the `PointerState` is set to `Exit`. In both cases, a `StateChanged` event is fired. The default value is 50ms. |
| FixationDuration | TimeSpan | Gets or sets the duration for the control to transition from the `Enter` state to the `Fixation` state. At this point, a  `StateChanged` event is fired with `PointerState` set to `Fixation`. This event should be used to control the earliest visual feedback the application needs to provide to the user about the gaze location. The default value is 350ms. |
| DwellDuration | TimeSpan | Gets or sets the duration for the control to transition from the `Fixation` state to the `Dwell` state. At this point, a  `StateChanged` event is fired with `PointerState` set to `Dwell`. The `Enter` and `Fixation` states are typicaly achieved too rapidly for the user to have much control over. In contrast `Dwell` is a more conscious activity. This is the point at which the control is invoked, e.g. a button click. The application can modify this property to control when a gaze enabled UI element gets invoked after a user starts looking at it. The default value is X ms. |
| MaxDwellRepeatCount | int | The maximum amount of times the control will invoked repeatedly without the user's gaze having to leave and re-enter the control. The default value is zero which disables repeated invocation of a control. Developers can set a higher value to enable repeated invocation. |
| DwellRepeatDuration | TimeSpan | Gets or sets the duration of repeated dwell invocations, should the user continue to dwell on the control. The first repeat will occur after an additional delay specified by `RepeatDelayDuration`. Subsequent repeats happen after every period of `DwellRepeatDuration`. _A control is invoked repeatedly only if MaxDwellRepeatCount is set to greater than zero_. |
| RepeatDelayDuration | TimeSpan | Gets or sets the additional duration for the first repeat to occur. This prevents  inadvertent repeated invocation. See above for details. |
| IsSwitchEnabled | bool | Gets or sets whether switch activation is enabled. When Switch support is enabled, the currently fixated element will not transition to the dwell state. Further, when the `GazePointer.Click()` method is called the currently fixated element will be invoked. |


## GazeElement Events
Add description here.

| Events | Description |
| -- | -- |
| StateChanged | This event is raised in response to each of the states associated with `PointerState` (except for the `DwellRepeat` state). An application can add a handler for this event to customize gaze related processing with respect to the various gaze pointer states mentioned above.|
|DwellProgressFeedback| This event is fired to indicate progress towards a dwell event. An application can handle this event to either customize visual feedback and/or turn off the default animation for dwell by setting `DwellProgressEventArgs.Handled` to `true`|
|Invoked|This event is fired when the library is about to invoke the control in response to a dwell event. An application can handle this even to perform custom processing before invocation, and/or suppress invocation by setting the `DwellInvokedRoutedEventArgs.Handled` to `true`|


## StateChangedEventArgs Properties
This parameter is passed to the `StateChanged` event which is fired when the `PointerState` changes.

| Property | Type | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
|PointerState|GazePointerState|The `GazePointerState` associated with this event|
|ElapsedTime|TimeSpan|The time the user has spent looking at the control to reach the specific pointer state above|


## DwellProgressEventArgs Properties
This parameter is passed to the event handling the `DwellProgressFeedback` event.

| Property | Type | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
|State|enum|This enum indicates the state of the control towards dwell in three values `Idle`, `Progressing` and `Complete`|
|Progress|double|A value between 0 and 1 that indicates the fractional progress towards completing dwell|
|Handled|bool|If an application sets this value to `true` the default animation provided by the library is suppressed|


## DwellInvokedRoutedEventArgs Properties
This parameter is passed to the GazeElement::Invoked event and allows the application to prevent default invocation when the user dwells on a control.

| Property | Type | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Handled | bool | This parameter is passed to the `GazeElement.Invoked` event. If set to `true` the library will suppress invoking the control on a dwell event|

## Examples

### To enable gaze interactions on the entire XAML page

Add the following lines to your Page element to enable gaze interaction on the entire page.

```xaml
    xmlns:gaze="using:Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.Input.GazeInteraction"
    gaze:GazeInput.Interaction="Enabled"
```

For e.g.

```xaml
    <Page
    x:Class="UwpApp.MainPage"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
    xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
    xmlns:gaze="using:Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.Input.GazeInteraction"
    gaze:GazeInput.Interaction="Enabled"
    mc:Ignorable="d">
```

### To enable gaze interactions on a portion of the page

Gaze interaction can also be enabled only on a portion of the page by adding the same attributes to any XAML element on the page. 

To enable only a subset of the page, e.g. just one Grid on the page:

```xaml
    <Grid gaze:GazeInput.Interaction="Enabled">
        <Button Content="Click Me" />
    <Grid />
```

In the above example, the button will be clicked when the user looks at the button in the grid for a period equal to the default dwell time.



### To change the dwell time for a control

The code below sets the Dwell time duration for the button to be 500ms. This means the button will be clicked 500ms after the control enters the Fixation state.
(See [PointerState](#PointerState) for details)

```xaml
    <Button Content="Click Me" gaze:GazeInput.DwellDuration="00:00:00.500">
```

### Animations
This library provides a default animation of a shriniking rectangle over the control to indicate progress towards a dwell event. The style of animation can be customized in two ways: 
* If you wish to retain the animation style, but change the colors used:
  * Set the `GazeInput.DwellFeedbackEnterBrush` property to add a rectangle over controls immediately gaze is detected on them
  * Change the `GazeInput.DwellFeedbackProgressBrush` property to change the color of the progress rectangle
  * Change the `GazeInput.DwellFeedbackCompletedBrush` property to change the color of the completed brush
* If you wish to completely disable or override the default animation, add an event handler for `DwellProgressFeedback` on `GazeElement` and set `Handled` to `True` as follows

```xaml
<Button Content="Click Me">
    <gaze:GazeInput.GazeElement>
        <gaze:GazeElement DwellProgressFeedback="OnInvokeProgress" />
    </gaze:GazeInput.GazeElement>
</Button>
```

```c#
private void OnInvokeProgress(object sender, GazeProgressEventArgs e)
{
    e.Handled = true;
}
```
