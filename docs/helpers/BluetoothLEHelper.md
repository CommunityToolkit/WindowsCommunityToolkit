## Example

```csharp
// Get a local copy of the context for easier reading
BluetoothLEHelper bluetoothLEHelper = BluetoothLEHelper.Context;

// check if BluetoothLE APIs are available
if (BluetoothLEHelper.IsBluetoothLESupported)
{
    // Start the Enumeration
	bluetoothLEHelper.StartEnumeration();

	// At this point the user needs to select a device they want to connect to. This can be done by
	// creating a ListView and binding the bluetoothLEHelper collection to it. Once a device is found, 
	// the Connect() method can be called to connect to the device and start interacting with its services

	// Connect to a device if your choice
	ObservableBluetoothLEDevice device = bluetoothLEHelper.BluetoothLeDevices[<Device you choose>];
	await device.ConnectAsync();

	// At this point the device is connected and the Services property is populated.

	// See all the services
	var services = device.Services;
}
```
