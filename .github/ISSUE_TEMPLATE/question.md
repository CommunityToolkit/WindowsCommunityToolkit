Hi!

We try and keep our GitHub issue list for bugs and features.

If this is more about a scenario that you think is missing documentation, please file an issue instead at https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/issues/new

Otherwise, this issue will be automatically closed.

Thanks!
