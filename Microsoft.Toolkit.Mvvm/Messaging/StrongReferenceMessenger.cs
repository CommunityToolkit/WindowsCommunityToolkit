        // Each combination of <TMessage, TToken> results in a concrete Mapping<TMessage, TToken> type, which holds the references
        // from registered recipients to handlers. The handlers are stored in a <TToken, MessageHandler<object, TMessage>> dictionary,
        // so that each recipient can have up to one registered handler for a given token, for each message type.
        // Note that the registered handlers are only stored as object references, even if they were actually of type
        // MessageHandler<TRecipient, TMessage>, to avoid unnecessary unsafe casts. Each handler is also generic with respect to the
        // recipient type, in order to allow the messenger to track and invoke type-specific handlers without using reflection and
        // without having to capture the input handler in a proxy delegate, causing one extra memory allocations and adding overhead.
        // This allows users to retain type information on each registered recipient, instead of having to manually cast each recipient
        // to the right type within the handler. The type conversion is guaranteed to be respected due to how the messenger type
        // itself works - as registered handlers are always invoked on their respective recipients.
        // Each mapping is stored in the types map, which associates each pair of concrete types to its
        // mapping instance. Mapping instances are exposed as IMapping items, as each will be a closed type over
        // a different combination of TMessage and TToken generic type parameters. Each existing recipient is also stored in
        // the main recipients map, along with a set of all the existing dictionaries of handlers for that recipient (for all
        // message types and token types). A recipient is stored in the main map as long as it has at least one
        // registered handler in any of the existing mappings for every message/token type combination.
        // The shared map is used to access the set of all registered handlers for a given recipient, without having
        // to know in advance the type of message or token being used for the registration, and without having to
        // use reflection. This is the same approach used in the types map, as we expose saved items as IMapping values too.
        // Note that each mapping stored in the associated set for each recipient also indirectly implements
        // IDictionarySlim<Recipient, Token>, with any token type currently in use by that recipient. This allows to retrieve
        // the type-closed mappings of registered handlers with a given token type, for any message type, for every receiver,
