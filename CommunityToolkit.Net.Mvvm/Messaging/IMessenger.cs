    /// An interface for a type providing the ability to exchange messages between different objects.
    /// This can be useful to decouple different modules of an application without having to keep strong
    /// references to types being referenced. It is also possible to send messages to specific channels, uniquely
    /// identified by a token, and to have different messengers in different sections of an applications.
    /// In order to use the <see cref="IMessenger"/> functionalities, first define a message type, like so:
    /// <code>
    /// public sealed class LoginCompletedMessage { }
    /// </code>
    /// Then, register your a recipient for this message:
    /// <code>
    /// Messenger.Default.Register&lt;MyRecipientType, LoginCompletedMessage&gt;(this, (r, m) =>
    /// {
    ///     // Handle the message here...
    /// });
    /// </code>
    /// The message handler here is a lambda expression taking two parameters: the recipient and the message.
    /// This is done to avoid the allocations for the closures that would've been generated if the expression
    /// had captured the current instance. The recipient type parameter is used so that the recipient can be
    /// directly accessed within the handler without the need to manually perform type casts. This allows the
    /// code to be less verbose and more reliable, as all the checks are done just at build time. If the handler
    /// is defined within the same type as the recipient, it is also possible to directly access private members.
    /// This allows the message handler to be a static method, which enables the C# compiler to perform a number
    /// of additional memory optimizations (such as caching the delegate, avoiding unnecessary memory allocations).
    /// Finally, send a message when needed, like so:
    /// <code>
    /// Messenger.Default.Send&lt;LoginCompletedMessage&gt;();
    /// </code>
    /// Additionally, the method group syntax can also be used to specify the message handler
    /// to invoke when receiving a message, if a method with the right signature is available
    /// in the current scope. This is helpful to keep the registration and handling logic separate.
    /// Following up from the previous example, consider a class having this method:
    /// <code>
    /// private static void Receive(MyRecipientType recipient, LoginCompletedMessage message)
    /// {
    ///     // Handle the message there
    /// }
    /// </code>
    /// The registration can then be performed in a single line like so:
    /// <code>
    /// Messenger.Default.Register(this, Receive);
    /// </code>
    /// The C# compiler will automatically convert that expression to a <see cref="MessageHandler{TRecipient,TMessage}"/> instance
    /// compatible with <see cref="IMessengerExtensions.Register{TRecipient,TMessage}(IMessenger,TRecipient,MessageHandler{TRecipient,TMessage})"/>.
    /// This will also work if multiple overloads of that method are available, each handling a different
    /// message type: the C# compiler will automatically pick the right one for the current message type.
    /// It is also possible to register message handlers explicitly using the <see cref="IRecipient{TMessage}"/> interface.
    /// To do so, the recipient just needs to implement the interface and then call the
    /// <see cref="IMessengerExtensions.RegisterAll(IMessenger,object)"/> extension, which will automatically register
    /// all the handlers that are declared by the recipient type. Registration for individual handlers is supported as well.
