# StorageFileHelper

The [StorageFileHelper](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.toolkit.uwp.helpers.storagefilehelper) is a static utility class that provides functions to help with reading and writing of text and bytes to the disk.  These functions are all wrapped into Async tasks.

## Syntax

```csharp
// NOTE This must be used from an async function
string myText = "Great information that the users wants to keep";
StorageFolder localFolder = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;

// Save some text to a file named appFilename.txt (in the local cache folder)
var storageFile = await StorageFileHelper.WriteTextToLocalCacheFileAsync(myText, "appFilename.txt");

// Load some text from a file named appFilename.txt in the local cache folder	
string loadedText = await StorageFileHelper.ReadTextFromLocalCacheFileAsync("appFilename.txt");

// Save some text to a file named appFilename.txt (in the local folder)
storageFile = await StorageFileHelper.WriteTextToLocalFileAsync(myText, "appFilename.txt");

// Load some text from a file named appFilename.txt in the local folder	
loadedText = await StorageFileHelper.ReadTextFromLocalFileAsync("appFilename.txt");

// Check if a file exists in a specific folder
bool exists = await localFolder.FileExistsAsync("appFilename.txt");

// Check if a file exists in a specific folder or in one of its subfolders
bool exists = await localFolder.FileExistsAsync("appFilename.txt", true);

// Check if a file name is valid or not
bool isFileNameValid = StorageFileHelper.IsFileNameValid("appFilename.txt");

// Check if a file path is valid or not
bool isFilePathValid = StorageFileHelper.IsFilePathValid("folder/appFilename.txt");
```
```vb
' NOTE This must be used from an async function
Dim myText As String = "Great information that the users wants to keep"
Dim localFolder As StorageFolder = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder

' Save some text to a file named appFilename.txt (in the local cache folder)
Dim storageFile = Await StorageFileHelper.WriteTextToLocalCacheFileAsync(myText, "appFilename.txt")

' Load some text from a file named appFilename.txt in the local cache folder	
Dim loadedText As String = Await StorageFileHelper.ReadTextFromLocalCacheFileAsync("appFilename.txt")

' Save some text to a file named appFilename.txt (in the local folder)
storageFile = Await StorageFileHelper.WriteTextToLocalFileAsync(myText, "appFilename.txt")

' Load some text from a file named appFilename.txt in the local folder	
loadedText = Await StorageFileHelper.ReadTextFromLocalFileAsync("appFilename.txt")

' Check if a file exists in a specific folder
Dim exists As Boolean = Await localFolder.FileExistsAsync("appFilename.txt")

' Check if a file exists in a specific folder or in one of its subfolders
Dim exists As Boolean = Await localFolder.FileExistsAsync("appFilename.txt", True)

' Check if a file name is valid or not
Dim isFileNameValid As Boolean = StorageFileHelper.IsFileNameValid("appFilename.txt")

' Check if a file path is valid or not
Dim isFilePathValid As Boolean = StorageFileHelper.IsFilePathValid("folder/appFilename.txt")
```
