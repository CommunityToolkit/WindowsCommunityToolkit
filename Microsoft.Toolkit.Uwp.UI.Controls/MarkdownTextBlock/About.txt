This project began as an independent open source project called Universal Markdown. It was originally created by Quinn Damerell
and Paul Bartrum for use in Baconit, an open source reddit UWP app.

The goal of this project was to make a universal markdown renderer control that's easy to use but is also very efficient. This 
control is intended to be used in virtualized lists, so the performance needs to be great. Thanks to a lot of hard work from Paul,
the control supports the full markdown syntax and is very performant.
