    /// An attribute that indicates that a given type should have all the members from <see cref="ObservableRecipient"/>
    /// generated into it. This can be useful when you want the same functionality from <see cref="ObservableRecipient"/> into
    /// a class that already inherits from another one (since C# doesn't support multiple inheritance). This attribute will trigger
    /// the source generator to just create the same APIs directly into the decorated class. For instance, this attribute can be
    /// used to easily combine the functionality from both <see cref="ObservableValidator"/> and <see cref="ObservableRecipient"/>,
    /// by using <see cref="ObservableValidator"/> as the base class and adding this attribute to the declared type.
    /// <para>
    /// This attribute can be used as follows:
    /// <code>
    /// [ObservableRecipient]
    /// partial class MyViewModel : ObservableValidator
    /// {
    ///     // Other members here...
    /// }
    /// </code>
    /// </para>
    /// And with this, the same APIs from <see cref="ObservableRecipient"/> will be available on this type as well.
    /// <para>
    /// To avoid conflicts with other APIs in types where the new members are being generated, constructors are only generated when the annotated
    /// type doesn't have any explicit constructors being declared. If that is the case, the same constructors from <see cref="ObservableRecipient"/>
    /// are emitted, with the accessibility adapted to that of the annotated type. Otherwise, they are skipped, so the type being annotated has the
    /// respondibility of properly initializing the <see cref="ObservableRecipient.Messenger"/> property. Additionally, if the annotated type inherits
    /// from <see cref="ObservableValidator"/>, the <see cref="ObservableRecipient.SetProperty{T}(ref T, T, bool, string?)"/> overloads will be skipped
    /// as well, as they would conflict with the <see cref="ObservableValidator.SetProperty{T}(ref T, T, bool, string?)"/> methods.
    /// </para>
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// In order to work, <see cref="ObservableRecipientAttribute"/> needs to be applied to a type that inherits from
    /// <see cref="ObservableObject"/> (either directly or indirectly), or to one decorated with <see cref="ObservableObjectAttribute"/>.
    /// This is because the <see cref="ObservableRecipient"/> methods rely on some of the inherited members to work.
    /// If this condition is not met, the code will fail to build.
