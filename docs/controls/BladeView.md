# BladeView XAML Control 

The BladeView provides a container to host blades as extra detail pages in, for example, a master-detail scenario. The control is based on how the Azure Portal works. 

## Syntax

```xaml
<controls:BladeView>
    <controls:BladeItem IsOpen="True"
        TitleBarVisibility="Collapsed">

        <StackPanel Margin="8">
            <ToggleButton Width="180"
                Height="100"
                Margin="0, 20, 0, 0"
                IsChecked="{Binding IsOpen, Mode=TwoWay, ElementName=DefaultBlade}"
                Content="Default blade" />
        </StackPanel>
    </controls:BladeItem>

    <controls:BladeItem x:Name="DefaultBlade" 
        Header="A blade"
        IsOpen="False">

        <TextBlock HorizontalAlignment="Center"
            VerticalAlignment="Center"
            Style="{StaticResource SubtitleTextBlockStyle}"
            Text="This is a blade with all settings set to default." />
    </controls:BladeItem>
</controls:BladeView>
```

## Blade modes

You can customize your BladeView control by setting the `BladeMode` property.
If you want blade items to stay unchanged (based on their respective width and height), you will choose the default mode (BladeMode.Normal).
Otherwise, you can extend each blade items to fill the entire container (example: Grid, StackPanel, etc..). To do that, you'll have to choose the Fullscreen mode (BladeMode.Fullscreen).

```csharp
public enum BladeMode
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Default mode : each blade will take the specified Width and Height
    /// </summary>
    Normal,

    /// <summary>
    /// Fullscreen mode : each blade will take the entire Width and Height of the UI control container (cf <see cref="BladeView"/>)
    /// </summary>
    Fullscreen
}
```

Here is an example of a BladeView where the `BladeMode` property is binded to a value in the code-behind.

```xaml
<controls:BladeView x:Name="BladeView"
    Padding="0"
    HorizontalAlignment="Stretch"
    VerticalAlignment="Stretch"
    BladeMode="{Binding BladeMode}">
</controls:BladeView>
```

## AutoCollapseCountThreshold

If you want to use the BladeView for handling a flow of actions, you can use the `AutoCollapseCountThreshold` property to tell it to start auto collapsing BladeItems after a certain threshold count has been reached. This will also help keep a clean, uncluttered screen real estate.

For example; if you set `AutoCollapseCountThreshold` to 3, the BladeView will start counting all BladeItems that are open in the BladeView and have their `TitleBarVisibility` property set to Visible. When the n+1 BladeItem, in our case the 4th one, is being added, the BladeView will auto collapse all n BladeItems except for the last one. All additional BladeItems that are added afterwards will trigger the same effect; collapse all BladeItems except for the last open one.
