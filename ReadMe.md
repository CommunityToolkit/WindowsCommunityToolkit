## NuGet Packages :package:
NuGet is a standard package manager for .NET applications which is built into Visual Studio. When you open solution in Visual Studio, choose the *Tools* menu > *NuGet Package Manager* > *Manage NuGet packages for solution...* Enter one of the package names mentioned in [Windows Community Toolkit Nuget Packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/communitytoolkit/nuget-packages) table to search for it online.

## <a name="supported"></a> Features :mailbox:
The [Features list](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/blob/master/docs/toc.md#controls) refers to all the currently available features that can be found in the Windows Community Toolkit. Most features should work with the October 2018 Update (1809) SDK 17763 and above; however, refer to specific documentation on each feature for more information.

## Principles :ballot_box_with_check:
* Principle **#1**: The toolkit will be kept simple.
* Principle **#2**: As soon as a comparable feature is available in the Windows SDK for Windows 10, it will be marked as deprecated.
* Principle **#3**: All features will be supported for two Windows SDK for Windows 10 release cycles or until another principle supersedes it.

## Roadmap :earth_americas:
Read what we [plan for next iterations](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/milestones), and feel free to ask questions.

Check out our [Preview Packages Wiki Page](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/wiki/Preview-Packages) to learn more about updating your NuGet sources in Visual Studio, then you can also get pre-release packages of upcoming versions to try.
