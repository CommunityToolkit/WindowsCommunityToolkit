# OneDrive Service

The **OneDrive** Service provides a simple way to access resources on either OneDrive or OneDrive for Business (Office 365).  You can:

* Authenticate using Microsoft Account, Active Directory or silently using OnlineId
* Access OneDrive folders and files in the same consistent way as local StorageFolder and StorageFile
* Perform CRUD operations on OneDrive resources

## Authentication

In order to use the OneDriveService you need to authenticate the user and get an access token

### OneDrive (Consumer) and OneDrive for Business - Converged applications

The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) supports v2 of the Azure AD service endpoint, which enables converged applications - this means that you can use the portal to register your app only once, irrespective of whether your user authenticates with their Work, School or personal Microsoft Account.  To register your app as a converged application, you need to:

1) Go to the https://apps.dev.microsoft.com portal
2) In the section Converged Applications, click on the "Add an app" button 
3) Register your application 
4) In the Platform section, click "Add platform" then choose "Native Application" 

You may then test this in the sample app by copying the "Application Id" from the portal page and pasting it into 
the Client Id field inside of the OneDrive services page.  To use the new flow, you need to select the "Work Or School Accounts Or Microsoft Account" authentication provider option.

Programmatically, you will now need to use the OneDriveService.GraphInstance property instead of the older OneDriveService.Instance property.  You may still need to use the older property for backwards compatibility, or for accessing features such as OnlineId authentication support, which MSAL does not yet support.  The APIs under the Instance and GraphInstance properties are very similar, so be sure to switch to the correct one when following the code snippets in the sections below.

For setting up your app against for the previous authentication flows, follow the steps below.

### OneDrive (Consumer)

OneDrive (Consumer) gives you two options in order to authenticate:

1) If the user is connected to a Windows session with a Microsoft Account, the service is able to silently get an access token.
    For that you need to associate your application to the Store (Project->Store->Associate App With Store...)

2) Or you have to register your app
  - go to https://dev.onedrive.com/app-registration.htm
  - When prompted, sign in with your Microsoft Account credentials.
  - Scroll to the bottom of the page (Live (SDK)), and click Add App
  - Enter your app's name and click Create application.
  - Copy the Application ID
  - Add a platform and select mobile application
  - Save

### OneDrive for Business

OneDrive for Business requires you to register your app in the Azure Management Portal:

OneDrive For Business you need to register your app from the Azure Management Portal
For more information to manualy register your app see go to the following article
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-scenarios#basics-of-registering-an-application-in-azure-ad
When registering your application don't forget to add the Office 365 Sharepoint Online application with the "Read and Write user Files" permissions. You should set your Redirect URI to "urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob". You may also need to add the following capabilities to your Package.appxmanifest: privateNetworkClientServer; enterpriseAuthentication


## Syntax

### Retrieve the root of your OneDrive

```csharp

// By default the service silently connects the current Windows user if Windows is associated with a Microsoft Account
var folder = await OneDriveService.Instance.RootFolderAsync();

```

### Initialization

```csharp

// if Windows is associated with a Microsoft account, and your project is associated with the Store then you may use OnlineId for seamless login. If you are doing this and initializing from a background task, then you need to explictly request that no credentials prompt be displayed.
OneDriveService.Instance.Initialize(Microsoft.OneDrive.Sdk.OnlineIdAuthenticationProvider.PromptType.DoNotPrompt);

// if Windows is not associated with a Microsoft Account, you need to initialize the service using an authentication provider AccountProviderType.Msa or AccountProviderType.Adal
OneDriveService.Instance.Initialize(appClientId, AccountProviderType.Msa, OneDriveScopes.OfflineAccess | OneDriveScopes.ReadWrite);

```

### Login

```csharp

// Login
if (!await OneDriveService.Instance.LoginAsync())
{
    throw new Exception("Unable to sign in");
}

```

### Retrieving files

```csharp

// Once you have a reference to the Root Folder you can get a list of all items
// List the Items from the current folder
var OneDriveItems = await folder.GetItemsAsync();
do
{
	//Get the next page of items
    OneDriveItems = await folder.NextItemsAsync();   
}
while (OneDriveItems != null);

```

### Creating folders

```csharp

// Then from there you can play with folders and files
// Create Folder
var level1Folder = await rootFolder.CreateFolderAsync("Level1");

var level2Folder = await level1Folder.CreateFolderAsync("Level2");

var level3Folder = await level2Folder.CreateFolderAsync("Level3");

```

### Retrieving subfolders

```csharp

// You can get a sub folder by path
var level3Folder = await rootFolder.GetFolderAsync("Level1/Level2/Level3");

```

### Moving, copying and renaming folders

```csharp

// Move Folder
var result=await level3Folder.MoveAsync(rootFolder);

// Copy Folder
Var result=level3Folder.CopyAsync(destFolder)

// Rename Folder
await level3Folder.RenameAsync("NewLevel3");

```

### Creating files

```csharp

// Create new files
var selectedFile = await OpenLocalFileAsync(); // e.g. using file picker
if (selectedFile != null)
{
   using (var localStream = await selectedFile.OpenReadAsync())
   {
     var fileCreated = await level3Folder.CreateFileAsync(selectedFile.Name, CreationCollisionOption.GenerateUniqueName, localStream);
   }
}

```

### Creating files - that exceed 4MB

```csharp

// If the file exceed the Maximum size (ie 4MB) use the UploadFileAsync method instead
var largeFileCreated = await folder.UploadFileAsync(selectedFile.Name, localStream, CreationCollisionOption.GenerateUniqueName, 320 * 1024);

```

### Moving, copying and renaming files

```csharp

// You can also Move, Copy or Rename a file
await fileCreated.MoveAsync(destFolder);
await fileCreated.CopyAsync(destFolder);
await fileCreated.RenameAsync("newName");

```

### Downloading files

```csharp

// Download a file and save the content in a local file
var remoteFile=await level3Folder.GetFile("NewFile.docx"); 

using (var remoteStream = await remoteFile.OpenAsync())
 {
     byte[] buffer = new byte[remoteStream.Size];
     var localBuffer = await remoteStream.ReadAsync(buffer.AsBuffer(), (uint)remoteStream.Size, InputStreamOptions.ReadAhead);
	 var localFolder = ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;
     var myLocalFile = await localFolder.CreateFileAsync($"{oneDriveFile.Name}", CreationCollisionOption.GenerateUniqueName);
     using (var localStream = await myLocalFile.OpenAsync(FileAccessMode.ReadWrite))
     {
         await localStream.WriteAsync(localBuffer);
         await localStream.FlushAsync();
     }
 }

```

### Retrieving file thumbnails

```csharp

// At last you can get the thumbnail of a file
var stream = await file.GetThumbnailAsync(ThumbnailSize.Large)
Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Image thumbnail = new Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Image();
BitmapImage bmp = new BitmapImage();
await bmp.SetSourceAsync(streamTodDisplay);
thumbnail.Source = bmp;

```
