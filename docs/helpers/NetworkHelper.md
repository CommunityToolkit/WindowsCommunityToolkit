# NetworkHelper

The NetworkHelper class provides functionality to monitor changes in network connection and allows users to query for network information without additional lookups.

It exposes network information though a property called ConnectionInformation. The ConnectionInformation holds information about ConnectionType, ConnectivityLevel, ConnectionCost, SignalStrength, Internet Connectivity and more.

***_What is a metered connection?_***
A metered connection is an Internet connection that has a data limit or cost associated with it. Cellular data connections are set as metered by default. Wi-Fi network connections can be set to metered, but aren't by default. Application developers should take metered nature of connection into account and reduce data usage.

## Example

```csharp
// Detect if Internet can be reached
if (NetworkHelper.Instance.ConnectionInformation.IsInternetAvailable)
{
}

// Detect if the connection is metered
if (NetworkHelper.Instance.ConnectionInformation.IsInternetOnMeteredConnection)
{
}

// Get precise connection type
switch(NetworkHelper.Instance.ConnectionInformation.ConnectionType)
{
	case ConnectionType.Ethernet:
		// Ethernet
		break;
	case ConnectionType.WiFi:
		// WiFi
		break;
	case ConnectionType.Data:
		// Data
		break;
	case ConnectionType.Unknown:
		// Unknown
		break;
}
```
