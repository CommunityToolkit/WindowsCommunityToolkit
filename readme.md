UWP Community Toolkit
===========

The UWP Community Toolkit is a collection of XAML controls, behaviors and services collected to make building UWP applications for Windows 10 faster and easier than ever before.

##Windows 10 Store App
Want to see the controls and behaviors in action before jumping into the code?  We have published the [UWP Toolkit Sample Application](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4tlcq) to the Windows 10 store.  Download the app and play with the controls live to see what they do before ever writing a line of code.

## Questions / Feedback

TODO: (UserVoice? Forum entry?)

## Principles
 - Principle #1: As soon as a comparable toolkit control or a service is available in official SDK, we will plan to mark it as deprecated
 - Principle #2: We want to keep the toolkit useful and not bloated with too specific services that will become hard to maintain
 - Principle #3: All controls / services are supported for 2 Windows SDK release cycles or until another Principle supersedes it.
